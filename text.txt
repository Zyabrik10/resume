                                              I am a second-year Computer Science student in WSZIB uniwersity in
                                              Krakow. Thanks to that I know basics of C/C++, algorythms. I have
                                              been self-teaching web developing for 3 years and for 10 months have
                                              been attending a Full-Stack developer cource. So I have solid
                                              knowledge in developing front-end and back-end with JavaScript.
                                              Thanks to that I have three non-commercial team projects where I
                                              served as a TeamLeader. My goal were to create good web application
                                              in short term and help my team to be one mechanism that brings
                                              success. These three projects are websites with different topics and
                                              different user experience.
